This is the very first app I made in Java, But I think the concept was awesome.

I tried removing as many bugs as I encountered, as well as making sure it works on MacOS & Windows..
(someone try it on Linux)

Its not my Idea, But since I've seen it, I wanted to recreate it.

The original piece of art is here - http://color.hailpixel.com/

It isn't as awesome as this guy's, But I've only just started with Java.

I've also added the full screen feature for Mac OS in it.
(Sorry, but windows doesn't have it)

This is totally free(just mention me if you also think its awesome).

Many of my friends think this can become a really awesome backgroud for their apps.
I'm not sure, but whatever works..

Any and all comments and stuff are greatly appreciated.. Try whatever comes to your mind with it.
It'd be awesome to see what you come up with!
